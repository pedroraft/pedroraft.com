                I developed this app alone, took about 2 months working part
                time to reach production. This app contains all the knowledge I
                gathered in react native, I used a library called xstate that
                creates final state machines to control service booking flows,
                this flows are highly complex and have a lot of variation of
                outcome depending on multiple factors, making it a perfect use
                case for final state machines, this library also allows you to
                visualize in interactive flowchart the logic of the machine,
                this sped up my iteration with the client and also made us sure
                that the ux flow had no flaws. It also uses a more advanced
                version of redux called rematch, one signal push notifications,
                firebase analytics, communication with graphql as well as rest
                apis, remote configuration, code push(this allows remotely
                updating the app code without releasing a new version) and
                animations with react native reanimated.

              Maxis was a tech startup, I was involved in a prototype project,
              the idea was to make payments using blockchain easy and fun, it
              involved an advanced reward and loyalty program for business to
              offer their costumers. We were a two man team so I was working
              full stack in this project. Unfortunately it never saw production,
              the project was scrapped after some news in Brazil regard crypto
              money laundering scandals, it was clear this was not the right
              time to launch this app. During my time there, I was involved with
              several other small projects, mostly simple sites and a few spa
              dashboards.
